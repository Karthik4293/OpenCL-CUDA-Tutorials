# OpenCL-CUDA-Tutorials
Sources for OpenCL and CUDA tutorials at http://jlaning.com

This is as much a learning experience for me as it will be with you so bear with me. I try to comment my code and explain what I am doing to the best of my ability however I will not be getting too technical.

I am compiling and testing my code with both Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community and MinGWâ€™s g++.

The point of these tutorials is not to develop parallel algorithms but to gain an understanding of how OpenCL and CUDA work.
